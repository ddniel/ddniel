# 👋 Hello, I'm Danny Becerra!

I am a highly responsible and positive software developer living in Canada, currently pursuing an AEC in Internet Programming at TAV College in Montreal. With a strong background in both frontend 🌐 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) and backend 💻 (Node.js, Express.js, Python) development, I excel in creating full-stack web applications. 

My projects include an Inventory Management App using the MERN stack. I have experience with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

I love to keep learning and I am truly passionate about technology and programming.
